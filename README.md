# Throwing Exceptions in Java Example 

The code provided initially prompts the user to enter integers, parses the input, and sums them up. It handles the scenario where non-integer inputs are encountered by catching the NumberFormatException and proceeding to the next iteration of the loop. Later modifications involve incorporating exception handling for various scenarios, such as FileNotFoundException, InputMismatchException, and IOException.

The program is extended to read student data from an input file, calculate GPA, and determine academic warning status for each student. It then writes relevant information to an output file. Exception handling is added to manage potential errors during file operations, such as FileNotFoundException if the input file is missing, InputMismatchException if the input format is incorrect, and IOException for general input/output issues.

The program effectively processes student data, computes GPAs, identifies academic warnings, and writes results to an output file. It handles exceptions gracefully, providing specific error messages for different failure scenarios. Testing with various inputs ensures robustness and verifies correct functionality, including handling of exceptions.
